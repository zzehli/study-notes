## MVC (from Agile Web Development with Ruby 7-Sam Ruby)
### Definition
* model: maintain the state of the application (representation of data in the database)
* view: generate user interface for display
* controller: receive events from outside (e.g. user input), interact with model, made it available for view (software that connects views and models)
### Model
* object-relational mapping (ORM): map database tables to object-oriented classes
    * rows -> objects
    * columns -> attributes
    * table level operations (find by id) -> class methods
    * row level operations (save an object) -> instance method
* Active Record: ORM layer in rails
### Action Pack: View and Controller
* view: a chunk of HTML code that displays fixed text (put dynamic content in the controller)
* dynamic content is generated by templates (embedded ruby, ERB, is the most common)

## [Rails philosophy](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine)
* Optimize for programmer happiness
* Convention over Configuration (most important?)
* The menu is omakase
* No one paradigm
* Exalt beautiful code
* Provide sharp knives
* Value integrated systems
* Progress over stability
* Push up a big tent
## Rails Performance (https://youtu.be/mJw3al4Ms2o?si=mPm-49XmEcl84bpx)
* monitoring
* DB (index)
* caching
## [RSpec](https://rspec.info/documentation/7.0/rspec-rails/)
* Behavior Driven Development: BDD is a process by which DSL structured natural language statements are converted to executable tests. The result are tests that read like acceptance criteria for a given function.  (wiki)
    * tests should be named in terms of desired behavior (set by the business)
    * behaviors are declarative rather than imperative (goals/results rather than steps)
    * behaviors are phrased in terms of user stories
* In RSpec, application behavior is described first in (almost) plain English, then again in test code
    *  It uses the words “describe” and “it” so we can express concepts like a conversation (https://rspec.info/features/3-13/rspec-core/example-groups/basic-structure/)
    * describe/it: The `describe` method creates an example group. Within the block passed to `describe` you can declare nested groups using the `describe` or `context` methods, or you can declare examples using the `it` or `specify` methods.

## Ruby
* Object-oriented language: allow objects to define data, functionalities and how to access these functionalities
* see `java.md` for OOP concepts
### naming
* instance variables begin with `@`
* local var, method names and params use underscore to seperate words instead of camel case
* class names, module names and constants start with an uppercase letter
* use single colon `:` to denote *symbols*: according to Programming Ruby 3.3, "Symbols aren’t exactly optimized strings, but for most purposes, you can think of them as special strings that are immutable, are only created once, and are fast to look up. Symbols are meant to be used as keys and identifiers, while strings are meant to be used for data"
### data type
* differences between single (does very little) and double quotes (look for things to process like `\n` and var `{na.capitalize}`)
