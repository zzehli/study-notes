# Asymptotic Analysis
## Principles:
* ignore small inputs
* ignore multiplicative constants (since it is sensitive to details of implementation, hardware platform, et)
* in a polynomial, focus on the fastest-growing term
## Asymptotically similar and Asymptotically smaller
* $f(n) \approx g(n)$, the two are similar if $f(n) \over g(n)$ approaches constant c when n approaches infinity
* $f(n) \ll g(n)$, f(n) is smaller if $f(n) \over g(n)$ approaches 0 when n approaches infinity
## common patterns
* algos for sorting have running time that grow like $nlog(n)$
* relationship of common primitive functions
$$1 \ll log n \ll n \ll n log(n) \ll n^2$$

# big-O
Asymptotic analaysis is well suited for well-behaved functions. Since comparing program run time can be messy, we use a more relaxed relationship called big-O. This means, big-O relationship is a non-strict partial order like $\leq$ while $\ll$ is a strict partial order like <.
* The base of logs doesn't change the final big-O answer, since logs with different bases differ only by a constant multiplier, $log_2(n) = log_2(3)log_3(n)$. This is due to the log rule, change of bases.

When g(n) is $O(f(n))$ and f(n) is $O(g(n))$, then f(n) and g(n) are forced to remain close together as n goes to infinity. In this case we say that f(n) is $\Theta(g(n))$

> Computer scientists often say that $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ when they actually mean the stronger statement that $f(n)$ is $\Theta(g(n))$

For big-o analysis examples, such as merge sort, see 15-algorithms.pdf
# Algorithms
## Backtracking (Erickson)
* recursion tree: The backtracking search for complete solutions is equivalent to a depth-first search of this tree.
* A backtracking algorithm tries to construct a solution to a computational problem incrementally, one small piece at a time. Whenever the algorithm needs to decide between multiple alternatives to the next component of the solution, it recursively evaluates every alternative and then chooses the best one.
* common characters for backtracking problems: 
    * goal structure is a sequence
    * each recursive step makes one decision, the the recursion requires a summary of the past decisions as its input; therefore in the middle of the recursion, the function try all possible next steps based on past decisions and decide wither these steps is acceptable
* use index instead of sub-array to represent the sequence/array

## Sort
# Data Structure
## String
### Trie
A trie is a rooted tree that maintains a set of strings. Each String in the set is stored as a chain of characters that starts at the root. If two strings have a common prefix, they also have a common chain in the tree. 

Each character can be represented as a node in the chain. The node holds two properties, one to represent if this character is the end of a word; another is linked to the rest of the string via a dict (so technically this is not a chain as in linked list)

Look up or adding a string in the trie takes O(n).
```
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.word = False
        self.children = {}

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        node = self.root
        for i in word:
            if i not in node.children:
                node.children[i] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[i]
        node.word = True
    
    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for i in word:
            if i not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[i]
        return node.word
        

    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for i in prefix:
            if i not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[i]
        return True

* about recursion, variable changed at the bottom will affact the same variable that is cached in the recursion above it. eg(test case: [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3]] and print visitList)
* pay attention to how the visited list is updated
### 994 Rotting Orange (Graph)
* initial thought:
    * breath first search
* to move to four directions, use (1, 0) (0, 1) (-1, 0) (0, -1) to represent a move
* besides the queue for bfs, needs another map to store the distance/time laps
* Why dfs doesn't work? Because the algorithm traverses from multiple starting points, only bfs would ensure that the "flood fill" spread as intended (similar to 733. Flood Fill)

### 133** Clone Graph (Graph, DFS/BFS)
* basic problem type, can be implemented in many ways
* needs a dictionary to hold all the nodes
### 200 Number of Islands
* initial thought: dfs on islands of 1s, traverse and turn 1 to 2
### 721** Accounts merge (Graph, DFS/BFS)
* construct the graph with email as key and a list of accounts as values
* because email identifies a person, use emails to connect accounts and merge them: eg. if A has email E1 and E1 is associated with [A, B], then A and B are the same person and A should have all emails for A and B.
* to merge the emails/accounts, iterature over the list of accounts, for each email Ei in an account i, traverse the graph to collect the all accounts associated with the email and traverse the account list, Li, since these accounts belong to the same person i.
### 127 Word Ladder (BFS)
* Initial thoughts: 
    * construct all posible word lists and choose the shortest
    * how to effectively see if two words differ by 1 letter en masse?
    * could use backtracking to construct words
* "So, all this problem is asking us to do, is find a shortest path from our start word to end word using only word inside our list." (https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/solutions/1764371/a-very-highly-detailed-explanation)
* an elegant solution that uses `string.ascii_lowercase` and `yield`: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/solutions/509769/java-python-bfs-solution-clean-concise/
### 79 Word Search 
* Initial thoughts
    * brute force and keep track of visited cells
    * there could be multiple starting points -> need to use bfs
    * the difficulty is that each starting point need to keep track of their track separately -> flood fill with bfs is hard to fullfil the requirements
* For iterative solution to work, need to add the state of the stack to another var: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/solutions/131327/iterative-python-solution/

    * construct all possible trees and compare their heights
    * construct a tree is a traversal
    * but how to calculate height?
* this q is unlike the other graph questions but it feels very practical
* the simplist solution treat the adjacency list as a tree and trim leaf nodes along the way until there are only 1 or 2 nodes left

## Array
### 121 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (sliding window, Kadane's algorithm)
* initial thought: two pointers
* method 1, too slow:
```

### 57** Insert Interval
* O(n) solution makes one pass through the array, compare the start/end of the new interval with the interval i, insert if no overlap, else create a new interval based on the overlapping condition
* don't seem to fit in existing categories of common solutions
### 56 Merge Interval
* the problem is similar to the one above, but the solution looks a lot simpler
* the main point of comparison is the 2nd element of the current array in the iteration with the last array in the resulting array. In 57, the resulting array isn't involved in the comparison
* when two array merge, only change the 2nd element of the array that is inserted in the previous iteration, no need to insert a new array

### 11** Container With Most Water (two pointers, greedy)
* instead of thinking about finding the two biggest elements in the list, which is global, start from two ends of the list and remove the smaller element from consideration. This move turns the question into a local comparison, a greedy algorithm approach

### 88 Merge Sorted Array** (in-place) (two pointers)
* move from the end of the word to the beginning
### 27 Remove Element (in-place)

### 189 Rotate Array
* in-place rotation thru reversal (a bit tricky)
### 28 Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
* design index so that the third index is not needed
* Q: explore KMT solution
### 55** Jump Game
* Initial throughts: this is a dynamic programming question: options at each step are fixed and can be memoized
* important lesson: how to prevent the loop from exiting early before trying all options with recursive calls?
    compare:
    ```
    for j in range(1, nums[start] + 1):
        if j > end:
            break
        return rec(j + start, end)
    print('here?')
    ```
    with
    ```
    for j in range(1, nums[start] + 1):
            if j > end:
                break
            if rec(j + start, end):
                return True
        return False

    The second solution will try all possible iterations in the `range` call before exiting. Remember, the return statement cannot be inside the loop

## Stack

* the solution is quite simple, since the arithmetic rule is straight forward, despite of its seeming variations
* the stack will keep track of all the numbers (and result of operation), when you iterate thru the expression, the operation is always performed on the top most numbers in the stack
### 155** Min Stack (stack)
* since the requirement is O(1), iterate thru the stack is not possible
* one way to go about it is to record the new minimum value with every push and retrieve the current minium from the end of the stack/array

## Binary Search
### 278** First Bad Version (binary search)
* This is a binary search problem in disguise. Investigate the suble differences in how the endpoints are defined as well as the loop condition. These would depend on the starting point
* In this question, although there is no target, the function call `isBadVersion` indicates where to find the diverging point where `True` starts. Then come up with appropriate left and right pointers so that one of them will end up at the diverging point.
* Solution:
    ```
        def firstBadVersion(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        left, right = 1, n

                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1

### 153 Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (binary search)

### 33 Search in Rotated Sorted Array (binary search)
* Similar to 153, but more thoughts needed to find the target, since knowing the rotation point is not enough.
* One solution is to list all possible senario and instruct how to choose in each:
    ```
        def search(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]

        """
        
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[right] >= nums[mid]:
                if target >= nums[mid] and nums[right] >= target:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1

                if target <= nums[mid] and nums[left] <= target:
                    right = mid - 1
                else:
                    left = mid + 1
        return -1
    ```
### 981 Time Based Key-Value Store (binary search)
* This can be solved by a speicial case of binary search that output the biggest value smaller than the targetf:
    ```
    def get(self, key, timestamp):
    values = self.__dict[key]
    if len(values) == 0:
        return ""
    left, right = 0, len(values)
    while left < right:
        mid = right + (left - right) // 2
        if values[mid][0] == timestamp:
            return values[mid][1]
        elif values[mid][0] < timestamp:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    if right == 0:
        return ""
    else:
        return values[right - 1][1]
    ```

### 506** Relative Ranks (heap)
* distinguish rank and position, create a map between them 
## Dynamic Programming
### 53** Maximum subarray (two pointers, dp, kadane's algorithm)
* the basic idea is to keep track of current sum and maximum value separately, then update maximum by comparing maximum and current sum; these two values can be considered a sliding window
* another important insight: don't judge the new value, instead decide whether the current sum is negative or not; the rationale is that even if the current value is negative, the current sum could still be positive thus useful for the future; don't look at the value in isolation
* there are two ways of track the current sum
    * none of the two comepare `currSum` with `currSum + nums[i]`, because this does not keep track of consecutive sum
    * one is to `max(nums[i], currSum + nums[i])`
    ```

        public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
            int currMax = nums[0];

            return max;

### 62 Unique Paths (2-d dynamic programming)
* a classic top down approach use case
* many solutions: https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/solutions/1581998/c-python-5-simple-solutions-w-explanation-optimization-from-brute-force-to-dp-to-math/
* recursion -> recursion with cache (bottom up solution)
```
    #same as recursion, add cache keyword to turn it into dp
    @cache
    def rec(i, j) -> int:
        if i > n - 1 or j > m - 1:
            return 0
        if i == n - 1 and j == m - 1:
            return 1
        return rec(i + 1, j) + rec(i, j + 1)
    return rec(0, 0)

    #avoid the cache keyword, use an array of array to store results
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        # brute force would be a dfs/bfs solution
        cache = [ [None]*n for _ in range(m) ]
        def dp(c, i, j):
            if i > m - 1 or j > n - 1:
                return 0
            elif i == m - 1 and j == n - 1:
                return 1
            if c[i][j]:
                return c[i][j]
            c[i][j] = dp(c, i + 1, j) + dp(c, i, j + 1)
            return c[i][j]
        return dp(cache, 0, 0)

```

### 322 Coin Change (DP)
* initial thoughts: 
    * isn't clear what the recursive step is since every case is unique in its coin combintion
    * could recursively find whether a given amount is possible given the coins
* bottom up dp approach:
    ```
        def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
            # tabular is an array that initialized with amount + 1 as the ct (fewest number of coins) at each index amount
            rs = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1)
            # when amount is 0, ct is 0
            rs[0] = 0
            # even tho rs has amount + 1 cells, the index of the array rs only goes to amount + 1: if amount is 2, we need an array of 3 with the biggest index 2
            for i in range(1, amount + 1):
                for c in coins:
                    if i >= c:
                        # don't need to know how to build the amount from scratch, simply build it by comparing i - c for all coins value c
                        rs[i] = min(rs[i], rs[i - c] + 1)
            
            # if the ct is amount + 1, it is impossible theoretically since the biggest ct would be amount, which is amount # of 1s
            if rs[amount] == amount + 1:
                return -1
            return rs[amount]
    ```

* Q: explore knapsack problem: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unbounded-knapsack-repetition-items-allowed/
### 70 Climbing Stairs (DP)
* easy problem, after investigation, realize this is somehow just a Fibonacci sequence
### 416 Partition Equal Subset Sum (DP)
* initial thought: backtracking seems to be a straight forward solution to this
* backtracking works, but most solutions suggest the knapsack problem as a more optimized solution
* backtrack with cache solution, notice how recursion is implemented:
```
    def canPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        target = 0
        for i in nums:
            target += i
        if target%2:
            return False
        target /= 2
        @cache
        def backtrack(currSum, index):
            if currSum > target or index >= len(nums):
                return False
            if currSum == target:
                return True
            return backtrack(currSum + nums[index], index + 1) or backtrack(currSum, index + 1)
        
        return backtrack(0, 0)
```
* Q: understand knapsack problem
### 118 Pascal's Triangle (DP)
* the edge cases are hard to figure out: 1st, 2nd rows and 1st and last element of each row are 1s (not sum of prev row)
* create a triangle and fill it with 1s: 
`rt = [[1] * i for i in range(1, numRows + 1)]`
### 746** Min Cost Climbing Stairs (1-d DP)
* This is a classic DP that can be solved by top down and bottom up
* backtracking solution (exceeds time limit):
```
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(cost) == 0:
            return 0
        if len(cost) == 1:
            return 0
        minCost = 0
        minCost += min(cost[0] + self.minCostClimbingStairs(cost[1:]), cost[1] + self.minCostClimbingStairs(cost[2:]))
        return minCost
```
* add memoization to backtracking:
```
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        l = len(cost)
        stack = [None] *l
        def dp(cost, index):
            if index == l - 1 or index == l:
                return 0
            if stack[index]:
                return stack[index]
            minCost = 0
            minCost += min(cost[index] + dp(cost, index + 1), cost[index + 1] + dp(cost, index + 2))
            stack[index] = minCost
            return minCost
        return dp(cost, 0)
```
* Q: come back and add bottom up approach with iterative solution
### 198 House Robber (1-d DP)
* similar to the previous, can be solved by bottom-up approach in an array:
```
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [None] * len(nums)
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], nums[i] + dp[i - 2])
        return dp[-1]
```

### 911 Online Election
* Initial thought:
    * in constructor, count the votes at each time frame; however, not sure which data struct to use since we do not know how many candidates are these in the first place
    * to find the lead, go to the closest time point and compare the votes to derive the lead
* Solution keys:
    * create a leads hash map to store the lead at each time point
    * use binary search to iterate through the leads
```
import java.util.Arrays;
class TopVotedCandidate {
    private int[] times;
    private Map<Integer, Integer> leads = new HashMap<>(); 
    public TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times) {
        int lead = persons[0];
        this.times = times;
        Map<Integer, Integer> scores = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < persons.length; ++i) {
            //increment the score
            //persons[i] is the index of the person
            scores.put(persons[i], scores.getOrDefault(persons[i], 0)+1);
            //compare the current score with the lead's score, update the lead
            if (scores.get(lead) <= scores.get(persons[i])) lead = persons[i];
            leads.put(times[i], lead);
        }
        
    }
    
    public int q(int t) {
        //binary search to grab the time smaller then t and return the lead at the time
        int index = Arrays.binarySearch(times, t) < 0 ? -Arrays.binarySearch(times, t)-2 : Arrays.binarySearch(times, t);

        return leads.get(times[index]);
    }

* for each element, check if x-1 exists, if not check if x + 1, x + 2, .. exists, then update the best consequtive array length
### 2244 Min Rounds to Complete All Tasks (math)
* initial thoughts:
    * use a hash map to keep track of the number of tasks at each level
    * iterature over the hash map and calculate the number of rounds needed
* hint: determine the pattern for counting the rounds needed by enumeration
* the following solution is correct, but not efficient:
```
        taskDict = {}
        for i in tasks:
            if i in taskDict.keys():
                taskDict[i] += 1
            else:
                taskDict[i] = 1
        rounds = 0
        for j in taskDict.keys():
            if taskDict[j] == 1:
                return -1
            elif taskDict[j] % 3 == 0:
                rounds += taskDict[j] / 3
            else:
                rounds += ( taskDict[j] / 3 + 1)
        return rounds
```
* use `Counter()`
```
        taskDict = Counter(tasks).values()
        rounds = 0
        for j in taskDict:
            if j == 1:
                return -1
            else:
                rounds += ( (j + 2) // 3 )
        return rounds
```
* use efficient data structure andfaster
```
class Solution:
    def minimumRounds(self, tasks: List[int]) -> int:
        k = 0
        c = Counter(tasks).values()
        if 1 in c:
            return -1
        for j in c:
            k += j // 3 + bool(j % 3)
        return k
