    "Broadcasting is a mechanism in numpy and pytorch that allows arithmetic operation on two arrays (including high dimensional) of different shapes possible. It makes adjustments to the array shapes to make them compatible. By default, numpy operations are done on an element-by-element basis, broadcasting can be seen as a way to conform to turn a smaller array to a bigger one before performing element-wise operations. Under the hood, broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. The basic rules of broadcasting is the following: two dimensions are compatible when\n",
    "1. they are equal, or\n",
    "2. one of them is 1 (we are not referring to the # of dimension, but the *size* of each dimension)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting dimensions are calculated as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the number of dimensions are not equal, prepend 1 to the dimensions of the array with fewer dimensions to make them equal length\n",
    "2. Then, for each dimension size, the resulting dimension size is the max of the sizes of the two along that dimension\n",
